PWMEval
============================================================================
Evaluation of Binding Models based on SELEX and ChIP-seq data.


Description
============================================================================

The Position Weight Matrix (PWM) is the most commonly used model to describe 
the DNA binding motif of a transcription factor. A PWM contains weights for
each base at each motif position. A PWM score can be computed for any base 
sequence of the same length by simply summing up the corresponding weights 
from the PWM.

PWMEVal is a software pipeline with a Web interface that is used to evaluate
the performance of PWM models using either HT-SELEX or ChIP-seq data.

SELEX sequences are enriched in DNA-binding protein motifs deriving from in-vitro
experiments targeted at selecting high-affinity binding sites from random libraries.

ChIP-seq data consists of both ranked peak sets for a sereis of transcription factors
(TFs) of interest or raw read alignment data.

Input to PWMEval is a set of sequences in FASTA format representing DNA-protein binding
sites of a TF of interest together with the PWM describing its binding motif.

For each sequence, the sum occupancy score is calculated, which is the sum over all motif 
matches weighted by their respective scores. The sum occupancy score is used to rank all sequences. 

For SELEX data, shuffled sequences are used as the negative set whereas for ChIP-seq data
the negative set includes 250-bp-long sequences extracted from flanking sequences 300 bp 
dowstream of each peak center. 


Here we publish two programs that are used by PWMEval: i) pwm_scoring used to score the
input genomic sequences and ii) seqshuffle used to shuffle FASTA-formatted sequences. 


Programs and utilities
============================================================================

The main programs are the following:

 - pwm_scoring          Score a set of nucleotide sequences in FASTA format, based on
                        matches to either an integer PWM or a base probability matrix.

 - seqshuffle           Perform regional shuffling on a set of FASTA-formatted sequences.
